# REORDERED

REORDERED, a PICO-8 game made for the Global Game Jam 2018 on the theme "Transmission". The game plays with the concept of out-of-order delivery in computer networking: the player must ensure letters sent between two antennas arrive in a different order than they were sent with, so they can form a meaningful word.

It was made in an unofficial location and is therefore not available on the GGJ website.

It can currently only be played with the mouse thanks to PICO-8's devkit, and does not
support fullscreen (as app or in browser)

Thanks to dwyl for the [english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) I used as an offline resource to find permutable words.
